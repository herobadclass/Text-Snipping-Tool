## Text Snipping Tool

A program that works like the Snipping Tool in Windows but identifies the text in the snipped image and saves it to the clipboard.

The program is written in Python with the main libraries used being **PyQT5**, **Pillow**, **PyTesseract**, and **pyperclip**. 

The Snipping Tool portion of this program is a modified version of [harupy's](https://github.com/harupy/snipping-tool) Snipping Tool app.
